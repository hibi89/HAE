## NEXT — HAE product name supersedes legacy AX FLOW (owner decision, 2026-10-27)
Use **HAE (Humanized Automation Ecosystem)** in all new customer-facing docs/UI and planning. Keep **Lightning Azent** for the independently developed workflow engine and **REA_APP** for technology analysis. Old AX_FLOW repository, axflow code/CLI/IR identifiers remain unchanged; do not silently rename any imported module, branch, package, endpoint or schema.
Continue active REA_APP → Lightning Azent → HAE acceptance order; no release or completion score changes from brand update. The remainder below is retained history/task context.

# Next work unit — 2026-10-27 KST (ACTIVE fast-track)

**Owner decision supersedes 21-week plan:** first 2 weeks REA_APP + own n8n-like runner; next 3 weeks AX FLOW + parallel DBVORA integration. Read docs/FAST_TRACK_5_WEEK.md, docs/TARGET_BLUEPRINT_V1.md, docs/CODEX_EXTRA_HIGH_ORDER.md before any implementation.

## Codex first authorized implementation unit (MVP D1–D3, REA_APP branch)
1. Verify hibi89/AX_FLOW current HEAD and read HANDOFF/STATUS/AGENTS/REQUIREMENTS/docs + actual code.
2. Build read-only bounded source walker and parser-accurate JS/TS import/export graph with file/line provenance under tools/rea-app. Python AST optional. Use a permissible local AST parser (TypeScript compiler API/Tree-sitter) with pinned version; no code copied from n8n.
3. Design small synthetic JS/TS fixture, run CLI end-to-end, return deterministic JSON+Markdown. Fail closed on huge/binary/secret/symlink/file escape cases. Never execute inspected code or mutate the source root.
4. Fix test failures; report **actual** commands, PASS/FAIL/SKIP, exact commit SHA and target blueprint gaps. Avoid asking owner to do work Codex can do itself. No blanket “finished” claim from skeleton.
5. D4–D6 permitted n8n study and original behavior contracts; D7–D14 independent executor on feature/axflow-mvp. Refer to work order for exact limits.

## Chief review gate
Compare every completed small module against docs/TARGET_BLUEPRINT_V1.md, identify high-priority missing features, and allow Codex to implement immediately within approved scope. First design decisions preselected for speed (bounded Python CLI + AST parser adapter, native JSON IR, SQLite, local-first). Escalate new paid costs/licensing, public visibility, user secrets, real external API/DB operations or destructive effects only.

## DBVORA parallel work
AX FLOW-side feature/dbvora-integration branch only. Check independent DBVORA source/API/Windows gate before committing adapter claims. No dependency on a nonexistent universal API; safe read-only SQLite inventory first. Preserve separate runtime and business SQLite.

## Safety
The active 2026 hackathon deadlines overlap Week 3; don't override submission priorities. 5-week target is conditional, no automatic background execution. Update STATUS/HANDOFF when actual implementation/test results change.
